                        Last year, President Buhari signed into law an Act that recognised June 12 as 
                        Democracy Day instead of the May 29 chosen by the military to formally hand over
                        power to civilian government in 1999. There were, however, mixed reactions in 2020
                        , when June 12 was pronounced as Democracy Day as there were doubts if the gesture
                        was actually meant to translate into good governance or bring about dividends of
                        democracy to Nigerians. Eminent Nigerians like former External Affairs Minister,
                        Professor Bolaji Akinyemi and Chairman National Democratic Coalition (NADECO),
                        Chief Ayo Opadokun among others, made a strong case for poverty reduction and good
                        governance, saying that it was only on that premise the purpose for which June 12 was
                        recognised as Democracy Day, would be achieved.
